	<img class="logo" src="{% static 'logo.jpg' %}" alt="">
	<p class="text">Did you know that at the current rate of expenditure of energy, non-renewable energy resources at the global level are likely to run out as soon as 2060? That means, based on the increase in consumption, all fossil fuels including oil, gas and coal are going to be depleted within the next 38 years. Our world is already fraught with rising energy demands, and as per data available, the total energy consumption of the world is expected to increase by 48% before 2040. This means energy management and conservation is extremely essential to continue using energy for every aspect of life on a global scale. But what is energy management?
	<br /><br>Energy management is the proactive, organized, and systematic coordination of procurement, conversion, distribution, and use of energy to meet the requirements, taking into account environmental and economic objectives. The simplest and most coherent way of ensuring energy management at our households is to implement the ‘Home Energy Management System’, which is what this website is about.
	<br /><br>This model, known as the CER, or the coherent energy regulator, is designed to provide guidance to a user in order to efficiently save electricity. It also makes the user aware of other sources that are friendly to the environment, which he/she can adopt depending on the location they live in. </p>
